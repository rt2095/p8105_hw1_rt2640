```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Question 1
This code chunk includes creating a data frame with sample size of 10 variables randomly selected from a normal distribution with values greater than 0. It also includes creating a character vector and a factor vector to create 3 levels and taking a mean of each of the vectors in the data frame.

```{r question_1}

q1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_numeric_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = vector(length = 10),
  vec_factor = factor(c("A","B","C","A","B","C","A","B","C","A"))
)
```
